The predictive analysis notebook focuses on analyzing student exam performance and building a machine learning model to predict writing scores based on other academic and categorical variables. The process starts with importing the necessary Python libraries such as pandas for handling tabular data, numpy for numerical operations, seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations, and scikit-learn for model building. After this, the dataset named “exams.csv” is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The initial steps of exploration involve checking the first few records using head() and the last few using tail() to get an understanding of the dataset’s structure. The shape of the dataset is examined to know the number of rows and columns, and descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values are obtained using describe(). To ensure data quality, missing values are checked through the function isnull().sum(), which is critical in predictive analysis since missing data can skew results or reduce model accuracy. Once the dataset is confirmed to be clean, the analysis proceeds with exploratory data visualization. A relational plot is created with reading score on the x-axis, math score on the y-axis, and the test preparation course as a hue variable. This plot provides insights into whether students who attended preparation courses performed differently compared to those who did not, revealing trends in performance clusters. Additional visualizations are produced by plotting the distribution of reading, math, and writing scores using histograms with kernel density estimation (KDE), which allow us to see whether the data is normally distributed and how scores are spread across students. To further examine the relationships among variables, a correlation heatmap is generated. The heatmap visually represents the degree of association between variables such as math, reading, and writing scores. Strong positive correlations, especially between reading and writing scores, suggest that improvements in reading often translate to better writing outcomes, which makes intuitive sense since both are language-based skills. After gaining insights from visualizations, the data is prepared for modeling. The target variable is set as the writing score while all other columns are considered as input features. Since the dataset may contain categorical variables like gender or test preparation course, they are transformed into numerical form using the pd.get_dummies() method with the parameter drop_first=True to avoid multicollinearity problems in regression. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using train_test_split(), with 70% of the data allocated for training and 30% for testing. This split ensures that the model is trained on one portion of data and evaluated on unseen data to test generalizability. For predictive modeling, a simple yet widely used statistical approach, Linear Regression, is applied. The model is trained on the training set to learn the linear relationships between features and the target variable. After training, predictions are generated for the testing set, and the performance of the model is evaluated using the R² score. The R² value, also called the coefficient of determination, indicates how much of the variance in writing scores is explained by the input features; a higher value signifies better predictive performance. The analysis reveals that math and reading scores are important predictors of writing performance, with reading score showing the strongest relationship. The correlation heatmap supports this observation by demonstrating the high correlation between reading and writing. Additionally, the test preparation course has some influence, with students who completed it generally performing better, although its effect is not as strong as that of math and reading scores. The visualizations also highlight that most students score within a particular range, but a few outliers exist with significantly lower or higher scores. In conclusion, this notebook provides a complete workflow of predictive analysis, starting from data loading and cleaning, followed by visualization for insight extraction, preprocessing for model readiness, building and training a regression model, and finally evaluating its performance. Although a Linear Regression model is sufficient to establish a baseline, more sophisticated models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks could be employed to capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, this analysis demonstrates the usefulness of data science techniques in education, as predicting student writing performance can help educators identify areas where students struggle, design targeted interventions, and ultimately enhance learning outcomes.
